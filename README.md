HOUSE OF HORRORS

I participated to the course "Learn Html & CSS" though the Open University before my ICT studies. Final assingmnet of this couse was to create some kind of web site with few pages in it using html and css. Content could be anything. JavaScript was not included in this course. Since I am a huge fan of horror movies and the culture around it, I created (imaginary) hotel and their web pages. I run out of time so there is a lot of lorem impum as a palceholders for a text, but what it comes to the visual aspect I succeed to create what I had in mind.

IMAGE GALLERY WITH DJANGO

This was a group assingment from my second year of ICT studies. Task was to create a web service where user can create an account and log in / log out. Also there shoud be functionality to the user to uploud images in defferent formats, at least JPG, PNG and GIF. Images should present as thumbnails at first and larger images when clicked. User can view images and it's informations, delete images and add new images. Optional task was allow user to sort images. 

My group members in this project was Mira H채m채l채inen and Hanna Sinkkil채.

JARI & TAIKA

This project was a part of Web Desing -period in my first year ICT-studies. Main focus was on HTML5 and CSS3, but also little bit of JavaScript was included in this course. The task was to implement an extensive and high-quality web page based on the given material. There was also four week time limit. Because I had some earlier experience about HTML and CSS, I wanted to challenge myself and this web page was implemented by using Bootstrap.

I feel I learnd the fundamentals of Bootstrap very well and understood it's popularity among web developers. On the other hand, because of learning Bootstrap I didin't have that much time for learning JavaScript. For that reason there is one huge problem in the website that I should fix: The banner (jumbotron) and footer should not reload everytime when moving from site to site.
