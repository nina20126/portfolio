This website was the final project of XAMK "Learn HTML and CSS" course where I participate through Open University before my current studies. Task was to create web site with few pages and try to use different technics learnd during the course (like form, image gallery, list, ect). Subject and theme could be anything.

I decided to create web pages to the (imaginery) horror-hotel. It's and old haunted mansion where you can book a room, and I tried to implement horror and gothic themes in visualization. 

I run out of time so there is lot of lorem ipsum as a placeholders to texts. I imagined to write a whole story to this hotel, but it took much longer to get the css the way I wanted than I expected. 

This course had focus only to html and css. No javascript or other techincs were included.
