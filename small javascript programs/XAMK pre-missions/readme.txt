These small javascritp programs I made 2020 when I applied to Xamk University of applied Sciences. It was my first time writing code (html & css is not coding, right?) so all variable names and comment are in finnish language.

In the comments there is first the assingment and then I'm mostly telling to my self what does the code do since it was all very new to me.
